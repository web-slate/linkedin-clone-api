## Contributing

Welcome to LinkedIn Clone API Contribution Docs. Below are the guidelines. Happy Coding !

### Commit Message Format

Each commit message consists of a simple pattern. Below is the
format that includes a **type**, a **scope**, and a **subject** and every Pull Request's commit should be squashed.

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject or your message>
```

## Commit Message Guidelines

Guidelines gives precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted. This leads to **more
readable messages** that are easy to follow when looking through the **project history**. But also,
we use the git commit messages to **generate the App change log**.

### Revert

If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert(<scope>): Your Message `, followed by the header
of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the
commit being reverted.

### Type

Must be one of the following:

* **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: maven, gradle)
* **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Netlify)
* **docs**: Documentation only changes like Swagger Annotations
* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **tech**: Any Technical Activities like clean up.
* **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

### Scope

The scope should be the name of the modules / directory affected (as perceived by the person reading the changelog
generated from commit messages).

The following is the list of supported scopes:

* **common** - In General Changes.
* **api/<apiName>** - API Changes
* **dto/<dtoName>** - Data Transfer Object Changes
* **mapper/<mapperName>** - Mapper Changes
* **jpa/<repoName>** - Mapper Changes
* **exception/<exceptionName>** - Excpetion Changes
* **service/<serviceName>** - Service Changes
* **dto/mapper/<mapperName>** - DTO Mapper Changes
* **model/<repoName>** - Model Changes
* **rest/service/<repoName>** - Model Changes
